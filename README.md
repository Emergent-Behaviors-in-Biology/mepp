This repository contains scripts and data to accompany arXiv:1901.09673, "The Minimum Environmental Perturbation Principle: A new perspective on niche theory."

Scripts are contained in two Jupyter notebooks, which can be opened from the Anaconda Navigator after installing the Anaconda Python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). "Rothhaupt Analysis.ipynb" contains the analysis of competition data from Rothhaupt (1988), while "Examples.ipynb" contains the simulations and graphical illustrations. 

"Examples.ipynb" also contains some preliminary code for experimenting with the consequences of MEPP for evolutionary dynamics.

PDF's of all plots can be found in the "Plots" folder, and the data extracted from Rothhaupt (1988) using the WebPlotDigitizer is saved in the "Data" folder.
