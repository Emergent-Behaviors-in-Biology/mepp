This repository contains scripts and data to accompany arXiv:1901.09673, "The Minimum Environmental Perturbation Principle: A new perspective on niche theory."

Scripts are contained in two Jupyter notebooks, which can be opened from the Anaconda Navigator after installing the Anaconda Python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). "Rothhaupt Analysis.ipynb" contains the data analysis, while "Illustrations.ipynb" contains the simulations and illustrative examples. The illustrations notebook requires prior installation of the Community Simulator package from https://github.com/Emergent-Behaviors-in-Biology/community-simulator.
